# Intro-to-Python
Hi there! These are some projects I submitted for my computer science classes related to using Python to parse text.

Some of the files require reading in text files, which I don't have anymore.
This is more of a way for me to track my progress and reference as I code to see how I've solved problems before.

Huge shoutout to Dr.Duke for being patient with me and my problems with Gradescope during this class. 
Feel free to browse! :)
