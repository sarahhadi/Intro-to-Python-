# Intro-to-Python
Hi there! These are some projects I submitted for my computer science classes related to using Python to parse text.

Some of the files require reading in text files, which I'm unsure about uploading since it's related to a VCU class. (#infosecurityprobs)
This is more of a way for me to track my progress and reference as I code to see how I've solved problems before.

Huge shoutout to Dr.Duke for being patient with me and my problems with Gradescope during this class. 
Feel free to browse and grab!
